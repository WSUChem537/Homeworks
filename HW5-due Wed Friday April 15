For HW#5 you will use the lecture notes from 4/6 and 4/8 to critically analyze the following two papers:

a) https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b00727
b) https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/j100024a046

For each paper you will answer the following questions:

1) What is the scientific problem being addressed? What is the expectation that the author creates in the introduction about the impact of the study?
2) What are the strengths and limitations associated with the computational methodology AND analysis? Are they aligned with the goals of the paper? 
3) What the take home messages in the R&D and are they justified based upon the data and analysis. How clear is the writing and the data presentation? Is there over-interpretation of the data?
4) Are the conclusions consistent with the R&D take home messages and the Introduction. 
5) What might you do differently if you designed this computational study?
