HW #3:

To help build your python skills you will do the following for your next HW - 

1) copy and past the last geometry from your Ar minimization into a csv file
2) start a new jupyter notebook that reads in this xyz file
3) using loops and the LJ potential that you plotted in HW#2 you will then calculate the sum of all of the pairwise energies in your xyz file - this should be close to the total energy that was at the end of your minimization in LAMMPS.

In the reading and analyzing the CSV file you will probably want to use the Panda's open-source python package. You can learn some of the basics here:

In calculating the pair-wise energies you will probably want to use loops. We will talk about this more in class, but here are some of the basics:

UPDATE:

-make sure you are using the same units as LAMMPS
-make sure you go over all pairs, but take into account the cutoff used for the LJ potential 
***NEW*** now add a section of your code to account for periodic boundary interactions (this means shifting the x, y, or z coordinates by the box size and calculating the distances so that you can account for interactions through the boundary)
***NEW*** calculate the % deviation of your calculated pair-wise energy relative to LAMMPS and report that in your notebook.
